// 1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?

// jsx syntax is required 

// 2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?

// an object that contains a list of all the properties of the jsx

// 3. What's wrong with this code:
// ```
// const page = (
//     <h1>Hello</h1>
//     <p>This is my website!</p>
// )
// ```

// there can only be 1 element in a jsx object with as many children as they need

// 4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?

// declarative tells the computer how to render and it figures it out, 
// imperative means you need to explain every step of a process

// 5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?

// create a larger thing out of many smaller components
